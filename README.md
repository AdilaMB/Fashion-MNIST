Fashion-MNIST: A Novel Image Dataset for Benchmarking Machine Learning Algorithms.

Image classification has become a popular domain in machine learning in recent years. In this work we perform a classification task on the Fashion MNIST dataset using several classification algorithms of different nature. Fashion MNIST is intended as a drop-in replacement for the classic MNIST dataset—often used as the "Hello, World" of machine learning programs for computer vision. The Fashion MNIST dataset includes 70000 grayscale images whose size is 28x28 pixels. In order to respond to that problems are applied 9 different classifiers: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naïve-Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM with cubic kernel, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP), and Random Forest. After training, the SVM cubic model was selected for to process the test set, which reached an accuracy of 90.55%. This result improves the classification used in reference documents, which translates into an increase in performance.
